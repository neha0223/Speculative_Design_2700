The stairs don't creak as you step on them. Every pace only seems to warrant a dull, metallic echo, leaving the stairway quiet and haunting.

It doesn't get much better as you reach the first floor, but it does get louder, in more than just sound. The house you're staying in is warm and homey, littered with fake-looking plants and family photos of various poses and children's toys- a lived-in clutter.

Ships stroll past the window, large and small, but they're quiet so you don't pay them much mind.

A clank of metal on glass from the kitchen, then:

"Oh, hello, ${name}!" Terra, your host mother.

  "I see you're wearing what we picked out! I'm happy you like them!
Did you sleep well?"

  #"Yes."
    "I'm glad. It's- It's good to see you settling in so well." 
    *goto next1
  #"No."
    She frown, eyes pitying. "Oh... I'm sorry, dear. Being in a new place is hard, I- I can only imagine how you feel."
    *goto next1
  #Stay silent.
    "It's alright," An awkward smile touches her lips. "You don't have to answer if you don't want to."

"Either way, you don't have that much time until you have to get to school. I'm assuming you still know the way...? It's fine, uh, I can give you the directions again, but first! Breakfast! Grab as much as you need to fill your belly." She makes to leave the room, but not before saying "I'm going to go check on the baby if you don't mind."

There was a variety of food in the kitchen: fruits, greens, eggs fresh off the stove, various meats.

  #Fill your plate. Don't want to go hungry!
    Everything could not look better and your mouth salivates at the thought of eating it. You feel gratefulness well up inside you. 
    *set plateFull true
  #Take a little. You're not that hungry...
    Stuffing your face may do the opposite of what you want, but a little can't hurt, right?
    *set plateHalfFull true
  #Skip breakfast altogether.
    The thought of eating anything makes your stomach churn. You'd hate to see what happened if you were to eat anything.

    ...Maybe not eating anything would be for the best.
    *set plateEmpty true
  #Leave the house entirely.
    Maybe it's just you, but the food is entirely unappetizing. The fruit looks too fake, the greens too discolored, the meat too plastic. In fact, the thought of staying in this house leaves you nauseous.

    Without a second thought or a goodbye, you take your backpack that had been leading by the wall, and leave.
