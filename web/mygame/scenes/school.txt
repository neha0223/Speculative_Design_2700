The walk to school is rather uneventful all things considered. 
*if (has_ruvenName)
  Ruven had yet to shut up, whether you answered their questions or not. But their chatter muted the stares and the alien noises around you, so if anything you have them to thank for that. 

  They do disappear from sight the second you reach the school gates, so there's that.

Being as tall as the person earlier seemed to be a norm, not a special case, making everyone tower over you like...

Now, standing in front of the doors, the glass a sticking blue against the deep red of the Martian lighting, nervousness hits you, making your legs wobbly and weak. You want nothing more than to turn around and flee, but... that would be cowardly, and you made a promise back to be brave. 

What do you do?
*choice
  #Enter school.
    You take a deep breath, hold it, before letting it do the fleeing for you.
    
    Without another seconds' consideration, you join the masses entering the front entrance. 
    *goto next1
  #Ditch school and go home.
    You can hardly bear any more of this, and the day has barely even started. 

    Without a second thought you pack your things and speed out the door, conscious of the eyes on you every step.

The inside is a pure pandemonium. 

People push you left and right, heading to their classes or noticing their friends or anything that makes you feel like a rat scurrying around a kitchen full of humans. Or no, not humans, everyone seems to have a large amount of metal on their limbs. So not humans. Cyborgs.

Someone's long fingers tap your shoulder, and you jump around to follow the source. 

A girl and a boy stand there, and you can't help but notice the way the crowd parts for them.

"Hello," the girl says, expression serene. "Are you ${name}?"
*choice
  #Confirm.
    The girl's smile widens. "It's nice to meet you, ${name}! I'm Daniella, this here is Tuan-" the boy waves- "we're a part of the school council, and we're here to show you around."
 
    She takes a step around you, ready to lead. "If you would follow me."

    You can't do much else, so you follow.

  #Deny.
    She laughs, although seems far from amused. "I know its you, and it's nice to meet you, ${name}! I'm Daniella, this here is Tuan-" the boy waves- "we're a part of the school council, and we're here to show you around."

The girl introduces herself as Daniella- what an Earthen name, you can't help but think- and introduces the boy as Tuan. Daniella does most of the talking between the three of you, with you following close behind her and Tuan following behind you, like some sort of vanguard. Tuan has yet to say a word, but he does a good job of pointing your attention on certain directions, away from the direction of the most people.

"Sorry for the stares," she says quickly, seemingly just noticing it. "We've never had an Earthling here before, people are just curious. I hope it's not too much."

You weren't aware people stilled called Eartheans 'Earthlings', anymore. You almost laugh, what an alien thing to say.

The girl stops with a bounce of her hair, before turning to you and Tuan. "This is your stop, the teacher should be able to help you with seating."

And with that, Daniella leaves you at the door to your class, Tuan following close behind her after giving you a nod. You can already feel the stares of your new classmates staring at you from inside, the feeling prickling and making your hair stand on edge.
*choice
  #Go to class.
    The teacher inside waves you over, and you can't help but head inside.
    
    Class is just as boring as it is on Earth, only with the added bonus of you having less of an idea of what's going on and people staring at you like you have two heads.

    The supposed lunch bell could not ring sooner.

The lunch room is as packed as any other place in this building, which you're starting to realize is the norm. What do you even do for lunch?

*if (has_ruvenName)
  Ruven pops up at your side, startling your out of your reverie. "Earth-Guy!" They greet, a smile and a half somehow fitting on their face. They make to pat your head, before they see your face and back out of such idea with a laugh. "How's your day been? Listen, I can't stay buuuut I can buy you lunch right now. My treat, no favors or dues. Whatcha say?"

  After Ruven leaves you, a girl approaches you.

  A girl approaches you.
She's beautiful when she smiles at you. "Hi! ${name}, right? We're in the same class, I was wondering if you needed a spot to sit?"

  "Funny," a voice says behind you, and you get to see how the girl's beautiful face pinches in annoyance. "I was about to say the same."

  You turn your head over your shoulder. A boy approaches you then, a proud lift to his head and a pretty smirk on his face. He practically hovers over you to go face to face with the girl. "Jade," he addresses, almost like an after thought.

  "Samir," she hisses. "Don't be mean."

  "Mean?" He laughs, "I haven't done anything. I was just wondering if the little Earthling wanted to talk to someone who actually has roots to their home planet." 

  And... It makes sense. He almost looks like someone you'd see on Earth.

  Almost.

  She- Jade- turns to you then, her hair sweeping over her shoulder as she bends down to look at you clearly. "You can eat with whoever you'd like."

  Jade looks as pleased as Samir does annoyed at your response. She takes your elbow, only not a light touch as she's careful of the food in your hands, and lead you away, leaving Samir by himself.

  "Don't mind him, he's a bit mean. Anyway, how have you been? I don't want you to feel like you're ostracized." Her lips quirk, "I also had trouble fitting in as a child, so I know people can be cruel, and I'm sorry if I did anything to make you feel unwelcome."

  "Now," you both settle at a table, "You tell me about your day, and I can tell you about mine."

  Samir looks as pleased as Jade does annoyed. She breathes though, and smiles at you, "If you ever change your mind I'll be right over there." She gestures towards a part of the lunch hall before leaving to follow her own directions.

  There's a hand on your, shoulder leading you to a table. "She wasn't lying, you see. I do have some Earth in me. My Nani and Dadi moved from there to here ages ago, and my family isn't well off so I've never been able to afford those metal cosmetic you see lying about."

  You're offered a chair, in which you sit, before he settles in front of you.

  "So you being here, do you know what it means?"

    #"What?"
      He smiles, and its almost plesant.

Walking out of the school is almost the same as walking in, as in you're still not trying to be trampled.

You do eventually make it out to the main road, and then on the route back home, ignoring the looks that follow you. Because of course school gets out just as literally everyone is passing by.

You just want today to be over.
