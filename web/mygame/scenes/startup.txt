It's a bright morning, an artificial sun beats down on you through the window.

Ugh. You'll have to get used to this.

Mars. 31XX. With its stupid fake daylight because of its stupid atmosphere can't make real daylight. And now it's shining in your eyes. Your curtains on Earth would never betray you like this.

You should probably get out of bed.

    Moving to the closet, a variety of clothing and colors hits you, both yours and things your host family bought for you. You're tempted to wear what you usually would at home, but Terra, your host mother, helped you choose an outfit last night. Should you choose that instead?
    *choice
      #Wear your own clothes.
        Maybe the comfort of the familiarity will make you more confident... 
        *goto main_menu
      #Wear what your host mother helped you pick out.
        You feel a bit uncomfortable. Hopefully the feeling wears off...

    Even the sinks here are odd... But it doesn't matter, you just need to brush your teeth.

    ...

    Now, how do you turn this thing on...?

    Lifting the covers over your head blocks the sun, so you're content to continue laying in bed.
  
    There's a knock at the door. 

    "Dear," a voices calls, almost hesitant. "I didn't hear movement and I thought..."

    A pause. Then: "It's time to get ready."

    You bite back your groan.

Okay, all done, time to go downstairs for breakfast.
